# My Resume
LaTeX code is based off a template generated at [resumake.io](https://resumake.io). I changed some things around using a LaTeX editor called [Texmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/).

## Usage
To generate a PDF from this LaTeX code, navigate to this folder in a terminal and run:

    pdflatex resume.tex

## Requirements
You will need to have `pdflatex` installed on your machine.

Alternatively, you can use a site like [ShareLaTeX](https://sharelatex.com) to build and edit your LaTeX instead, or Texmaker.
